# Predicting Zomato Restaurants Ratings

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict restaurant ratings on the Zomato platform using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of regression models to predict ratings based on various restaurant features.

## Key Features of the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data trends, distributions, and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features for optimal model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Applying various regression models to predict ratings.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the models based on performance metrics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook (`Zomato Rating Prediction.ipynb`) step by step to execute the code and visualize the outputs.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Import the Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
```

This section imports necessary libraries for data manipulation (Numpy, Pandas), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and machine learning (Scikit-learn).

### 2. Load the Data

```python
data = pd.read_csv('zomato.csv')
data.head()
```

Here, the Zomato dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualize distributions and relationships**:

  ```python
  sns.histplot(data['rating'])
  plt.title('Rating Distribution')
  ```

  This visualizes the distribution of restaurant ratings.

- **Correlation Analysis**:

  ```python
  sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True)
  ```

  Displays correlations between numerical features in the dataset.

### 4. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values and outliers:
  ```python
  ```

data.dropna(inplace=True)

````
This step ensures the dataset is clean for modeling.

### 5. Feature Engineering
- Convert categorical features to numerical:
   ```python
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['feature_name'], drop_first=True)
````

Here, categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.

### 6. Model Training and Testing

- Split data into training and testing sets:
  ```python
  ```

X\_train, X\_test, y\_train, y\_test = train\_test\_split(X, y, test\_size=0.2, random\_state=42)

````
- Train models:
   ```python
   model = RandomForestRegressor()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
````

RandomForest is one of the models used for training.

### 7. Model Evaluation

- Assess performance:
  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  print('R2 Score:', r2_score(y_test, predictions))
  ```
  Metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error are calculated to evaluate model accuracy.

## Results

- The best model for predicting Zomato restaurant ratings is identified based on evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for predicting restaurant ratings. It showcases end-to-end development, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing insights into feature importance and model performance.
